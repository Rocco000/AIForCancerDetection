# AIForCancerDetection
 In this project  we will focus on skin cancer, namely the melanoma. Melanoma is a malignancy of melanocytes, which are pigment-producing cells of neuroectodermal origin that can be found throughout the body (including in the skin, iris and rectum). The cutaneous form of the disease is common in the Western world and causes the majority (75\%) of deaths related to skin cancer; its global incidence is 15â€“25 per 100,000 individuals. Survival rates in patients with melanoma (cumulative for all forms) have shown a huge differences between countries in Europe, ranging between <50\% in Eastern Europe to >90\% in northern and central Europe for 5-year survival after primary diagnosis.
 
 We decided to call our model OncuVision because this name combines "oncology", the study and treatment of cancer, with "vision", emphasizing the system's ability to "see" cancer cells at a microscopic level.

Documentation directory contains the documentation, images, etc. of the project.
Scripts directory contains all code necessary for develop melanoma detection AI system.
