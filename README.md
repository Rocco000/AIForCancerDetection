# AIForCancerDetection
In this project  we will focus on develop a cancer detection AI system, in particular colorectal cancer. We decided to studied this type of cancer because it is estimated that, in [EU-27 countries in 2020](https://healthcare-quality.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ecicc), Colorectal Cancer (CRC) accounted for 12.7% of all new cancer diagnoses and 12.4% of all deaths due to cancer. It is the second cause of cancer death in men (after lung cancer) and the third one in women (after breast and lung cancers).  It's demostrare that when diagnosed at stage I, the overall 5-year survival rate is around 90%, whereas it is only around 10% in the metastatic stage IV. It is estimated that, only around 13% of patients are diagnosed at stage IV. For this reasons, in this project we want to develop an AI system that detect a colorectal cancer in order to help physicians in the diagnosed process of cancer.

Documentation directory contains the documentation, images, etc. of the project.
Scripts directory contains all code necessary for develop colorectal cancer detection AI system.
